# zInfiniteScroll

It is a module for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) which allow you to attach an event handler to the element when this element
has been scrolled almost to its bottom. In most of the case it will be used for infinite scrolling.
It is very light and optimized to reduce the amount of $digest loop.

zInfiniteScroll was forked from lrInfiniteScroll, but more functionality and browser compatibility even on mobile.

## Installation

Using bower

    bower install zInfiniteScroll
    
Using npm

    npm install zinfinitescroll

## Demo
[Body scroll down](http://lightzam.github.io/zInfiniteScroll/example01_bodyScroll.html)

[Body scroll up](http://lightzam.github.io/zInfiniteScroll/example02_bodyScroll_inverse.html)

[Normal scroll down](http://lightzam.github.io/zInfiniteScroll/example03_normalScroll.html)

[Normal scroll up](http://lightzam.github.io/zInfiniteScroll/example04_normalScroll_inverse.html)

## Attach an event handler

simply set as attribute a function accessible within the $scope

```html
<ul z-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```

## use infinite scroll without set height on your element

use the body as scroll target

```html
<ul z-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler" body-scroll="true">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```

## scroll to top

scroll to up and load your data by myEventHandler when it scrolled almost to its top

```html
<ul z-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler" inverse="true">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```

## Change the scroll threshold

By default the handler will be called when the user is scrolling *down* and only *50* pixels are remaining before reaching the end
of the element. You can overwrite the 50px by setting the attribute *scroll-threshold*

```html
<ul z-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler" scroll-threshold="200">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```
## Change the time threshold

To reduce the amount of $digest loop, instead of calling the handler whenever a scroll down event is detected in the end zone. A time is started and if
no other event is detected within 400ms, then the handler is called. You can overwrite the time value by setting the *time-threshold* attribute.

```html
<ul z-infinite-scroll="myEventHandler" scroll-threshold="200" time-threshold="600">
    <li ng-repeat="item in myCollection">
</ul>
```
